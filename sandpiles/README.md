Write a function that computes the sum of two sandpiles

    Prototype: void sandpiles_sum(int grid1[3][3], int grid2[3][3]);
    You can assume that both grid1 and grid2 are individually stable
    A sandpile is considered stable when none of its cells contains more than 3 grains
    When your function is done, grid1 must be stable
    grid1 must be printed before each toppling round, only if it is unstable (See example)
    Youâ€™re not allowed to allocate memory dynamically
